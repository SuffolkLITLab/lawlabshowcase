    <p>
      The Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab is an experiential program combining the vision of our Legal Innovation and Technology Institute with the pedagogy and legal services mission of our Clinical Programs. The Lab allows students to work as part of a consultancy and research & development (R&D) shop focused on legal tech and data science work. Active areas of research involve, but are not limited to, the construction of expert systems/guided interviews (e.g., chatbots) and algorithmic codification of tacit knowledge (i.e., training computers to replicate human decisions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lab students develop legal technology and data science solutions for organizational clients (e.g., legal aid organizations, courts, firms, and non-profits), helping them improve efficiency and effectiveness. Theses services are provided to organizational clients, who frequently do not have in-house expertise in automating tools, engaging in process improvement, and data analytics.

      Law, Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Lab (LITE Lab) is an interdisciplinary and experiential programme led by the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law in conjunction with the Department of Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the lean startups it works with, LITE Lab@HKU has evolved since its founding in 2019 (see <a href="https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2019/10/21/meet-lite-lab-hong-kongs-pioneering-legal-innovation-project/" target="_blank">Artificial Lawyer article</a>) and currently prepares the legal professionals of the future by offering undergraduate and postgraduate law students as well as those from other university disciplines numerous curricular and extracurricular opportunities to:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1)   learn entrepreneurship in and through the law, including through their roles in what we call a 21st century law review creating blogs, infographics, animated video explainers and document automation for LITE Lab@HKU’s upcoming website revamp that aims to benefit under-resourced organisations;
    </p>
    <p>
      (2)   engage with and support the Hong Kong tech startup and innovation ecosystem through co-designed student research and internships (more than 70 to date), often involving emerging technologies, business models and the law; and
    </p>
    <p>
      (3)   co-design impactful proof-of-concept lawtech solutions with NGOs, social entrepreneurs and the private sector. Our students have already created internationally recognized access-to-justice projects (eg, <a href="http://www.hk-lawyer.org/content/hong-kong-university-students-win-inaugural-iron-tech-lawyer-invitational-creating-ai" target="_blano">2020 Georgetown Law Iron Tech Lawyer Invitational</a>), launched lawtech startups, and are working with leading regional corporate counsel on their legal automation painpoints as part of a new innovative collaboration initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      LITE Lab@HKU faculty also engages in scholarly research in areas such as AI governance (eg, Wiley’s The AI Book, The Legaltech Book The Regtech Book and The Fintech Book) as well as legal innovation and technology industry studies with organisations such as the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iHChzxzZY3evC6-LOLD5CQl1yPYiwLZD/view" target="_blank">Association of Corporate Counsel</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLiSwQ7XAkBIpXS55D4udr-fKMmfJarM/view" target="_blank">Asia Pacific Legal Innovation and Technology Association (ALITA)</a>. ​

    <p>
      The Flinders University Digital Law Lab was established in February 2021 and provides legal technology services to not-for-profit and government organisations primarily in South Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed with the purpose of ‘closing the loop’, the Digital Law Lab provides ongoing maintenance for legal software applications developed by Flinders University law students.
    </p>
    <p>
      All students studying a law degree at Flinders University are required to study LLAW3301: Law in a Digital Age.  In Digital Age, students learn coding skills, using Docassemble, and are engaged by real-world clients to develop real-world applications with a view to improving access to justice.  Since launching Digital Age in 2019, a number of student applications have been commissioned for day-to-day use by their not-for-profit clients, with many more in the pipleline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Digital Law Lab comes into play when a client decides to commission a software application written by Digital Age students.  Interns in the Digital Law Lab work through the commissioning process, auditing the underlying law implemented by the app, making any changes requested by the client, and commissioning the application.  After commissioning, the Digital Law Lab is tasked with providing ongoing maintenance to the commissioned apps, ranging from bug fixes, to ensuring the application code remains up-to-date with the underlying law as the law changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the Digital Law Lab ‘closes the loop’.  In combination with Digital Age, the Lab is part of an end-to-end solution for not-for-profit and government organisations that engage with Flinders University.  Students develop new applications and those applications are supported and maintained on an ongoing basis, providing support to the access to justice community and improving access to justice through legal technology.

    <p>
      The <a href="https://law.arizona.edu/innovation-for-justice" target="_blank">Innovation for Justice Program (i4J)</a> at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law is a social justice innovation lab that designs, builds, and tests disruptive solutions to the justice gap. Barriers to entry, power imbalances, and flawed processes exclude marginalized populations from effective use of the civil legal system and inhibit the system from delivering on the promise of justice for all. i4J’s interdisciplinary research teams apply design- and systems-thinking methodologies and engage in action-based research that exposes inequalities in the legal system and creates new, replicable strategies for legal empowerment.
    </p><p>
      i4J recognizes that change does not happen in silos; innovation calls for broad insight, engagement, and support. i4J's teams of interdisciplinary students collaborate with nonprofit, government, and private sectors, as well as lived-experienced experts, to create new models for delivering legal empowerment to underrepresented populations.
    </p><p>
      Through several <a href="https://law.arizona.edu/innovation-for-justice-curriculum" target="_blank">community-engaged research opportunities</a>, i4J students are exposed to the justice gap, trained to think critically about the power of technology and innovation to close that gap, and empowered to act as disruptive problem-solvers in the changing world of legal services.

    <p>Vanderbilt launched its Program on Law and Innovation (PoLI) in 2015 to train the next generation of lawyers to succeed in tomorrow’s legal environment by anticipating the opportunities created by the changes in law and legal practice. PoLI’s curriculum and activities focus on four related themes:
    </p><ul>
    <li><b>The Legal Industry.</b> Legal service providers of all sizes and types are restructuring and changing the ways their lawyers practice. Traditional law firms now compete for business with new types of legal service providers, including legal project management firms and document review shops. New legal jobs, such as legal risk consultants and legal knowledge managers, are now available.
    <li><b>Legal Technologies.</b> Computers are increasingly doing legal work, from reviewing documents for relevant information to predicting liabilities and litigation outcomes using computer algorithms. These technologies allow lawyers to deliver more efficient and reliable services and results. They also affect the demand for lawyers and the skillsets needed to deliver legal services.
    <li><b>Legal Innovation and Entrepreneurship.</b> Fueled by rapid social, economic, and technological changes, the demand for change in law is also on the rise. Existing regulations don’t address the issues raised by new technologies such as commercial drones, and new financial products that present uncertain risks demand new strategies for public oversight. Young lawyers with an entrepreneurial eye can quickly develop expertise in an emerging or evolving area of law.
    <li><b>Access to Legal Services.</b> Most people and businesses could not afford top-quality legal services in the past. As lawyers become more efficient and legal technologies more widely available, the availability of affordable legal services will open new markets for entrepreneurial lawyers and legal enterprises.
    </ul>
    <p>
    PoLI’s <a href="https://law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/law-and-innovation/curriculum.php" target="_blank">curriculum</a> and <a href="https://law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/law-and-innovation/activities.php" target="_blank">activities</a> expose Vanderbilt Law students to these and other changes in the legal industry that will have profound influence on the way they practice law.
    </p><p>
    PoLI’s newest venture is its Design the Law Lab, a cross-disciplinary design studio focused on co-creating access to justice solutions using the methods and tools of human-centered design. Housed at the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/thewondry/" target="_blank">Wond’ry</a>, Vanderbilt’s center for innovation, the Design the Law Lab is launching in the fall of 2021.

    <p>
      The Center for Legal Innovation at Vermont Law School is the home to our Entrepreneurship Legal Laboratory which focuses on the creation of innovative scalable legal solutions for low-bono and pro-bono start-up clients.  Our program has flourished by forging a relationship with the VtSBDC to provide legal education applications for small Vermont businesses.  These applications are distributed state-wide and used by the VtSBDC advisors to assist their small business clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a student learning perspective, students research the area of law that has been identified by the VtSBDC advisors as an area of need for their small business clients. With the guidance of faculty and local attorney practitioners, students create an application that addresses the legal needs surfaced by the VtSBDC.  Through the efforts of our students, rural Vermont small businesses are given free access to the law.
